# Netflix Clone

# Summary: 

This is a simple netflix clone app built using React and the TMDB API. React-Youtube and movieTrailer were also used for the trailers in the final version in the app.
The user can browse the shows on the netflix clone and upon click they will be served a trailer. All the titles get pulled from the API and upon refresh the banner on top 
changes just as it would on netflix.
